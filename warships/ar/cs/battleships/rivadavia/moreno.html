                <p>"Moreno" was a dreadnought battleship of the Rivadavia class, ordered in 1910 by the Argentine
                    Navy
                    and launched in 1911 by the American shipyards of New York Shipbuilding. It was a response to
                    the
                    Brazilian Minas Gerais class and to strengthen the Argentine position in the river, maritime and
                    land disputes with Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. It was commissioned in 1915. It did not
                    participate in
                    world conflicts, but it was highly active in its training, surveillance and diplomatic relations
                    tasks. In the mid-1920s, its machinery and firing systems were modernized and throughout the
                    1930s,
                    complementary armaments and other equipment and structures were modified. A few years after the
                    Second World War, the ship stopped providing active service and in 1956 it was finally
                    decommissioned</p>
                <p>"Moreno" and its twin are possibly the best dreadnought-type battleships that have ever sailed
                    (with
                    a 305-millimeter battery), since the set of their main and additional armament, their general
                    protection and their mobility, made them more competent than other ships with similar
                    characteristics and, however, with flaws in some of these aspects. The modernized battleship
                    continued to maintain the characteristic distribution of towers on the center line and in
                    echelon
                    and incorporated new fire directors, anti-aircraft machine-gun.s, new armor-piercing projectiles
                    and
                    doubled the loading speed of its main battery. However, it removed the 102-millimeter tertiary
                    battery. Protection remained the same, missing the opportunity to add anti-torpedo bulges. With
                    the
                    modernization of the machinery, the maximum power and speed increased and with the
                    compartmentalization to house oil, the displacement increased considerably, even surpassing many
                    super-dreadnoughts. In addition, the warship tested and/or incorporated optics, paravanes,
                    seaplanes, smoke screens, sonar, and others</p>

                    War
                    Two. In other words, it represents the design of its class after its modernization and,

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>"Moreno" was a dreadnought battleship of the Rivadavia class, ordered in 1910 by the Argentine
                    Navy
                    and launched in 1911 by the American shipyards of New York Shipbuilding. It was a response to
                    the
                    Brazilian Minas Gerais class and to strengthen the Argentine position in the river, maritime and
                    land disputes with Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. It was commissioned in 1915. It did not
                    participate in
                    world conflicts, but it was highly active in its training, surveillance and diplomatic relations
                    tasks. In the mid-1920s, its machinery and firing systems were modernized and throughout the
                    1930s,
                    complementary armaments and other equipment and structures were modified. A few years after the
                    Second World War, the ship stopped providing active service and in 1956 it was finally
                    decommissioned</p>
                <p>"Moreno" and its twin are possibly the best dreadnought-type battleships that have ever sailed
                    (with
                    a 305-millimeter battery), since the set of their main and additional armament, their general
                    protection and their mobility, made them more competent than other ships with similar
                    characteristics and, however, with flaws in some of these aspects. The modernized battleship
                    continued to maintain the characteristic distribution of towers on the center line and in
                    echelon
                    and incorporated new fire directors, anti-aircraft machine-gun.s, new armor-piercing projectiles
                    and
                    doubled the loading speed of its main battery. However, it removed the 102-millimeter tertiary
                    battery. Protection remained the same, missing the opportunity to add anti-torpedo bulges. With
                    the
                    modernization of the machinery, the maximum power and speed increased and with the
                    compartmentalization to house oil, the displacement increased considerably, even surpassing many
                    super-dreadnoughts. In addition, the warship tested and/or incorporated optics, paravanes,
                    seaplanes, smoke screens, sonar, and others</p>
                <p>"Moreno (1938)" is here suggested with the characteristics that it had before the start of World
                    War
                    Two. In other words, it represents the design of its class after its modernization and,
                    additionally, with a set of additional modifications that occurred in the following years</p>
